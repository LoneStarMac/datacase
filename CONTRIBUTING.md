## ✍️ Ways You Can Contribute

### 1. Add a New Engine

* Place your engine JSON file in `/data/engines/`
* Follow the structure defined in `/schemas/engine_schema.json`
* Set the `status` field to `usr_sub` if unverified

### 2. Fix or Enhance Existing Data

* Update any JSON file while maintaining schema compliance
* Run `validate_json_schema.py` from `/tools/` to check your changes

### 3. Add SVG or Technical Diagrams

* Place SVGs or related files in `/docs/media/`
* Link them in the corresponding engine JSON using a key like `bellhousing_svg`

### 4. Improve Scripts or Frontend

* Add enhancements to `/tools/` (scripts)
* Modify `/docs/` (frontend)

## ✅ Validation Workflow

Every commit to `main` triggers the following:

* JSON validation via GitHub Action
* CSV regeneration from all engine files
* Logging to `/tools/logs/`

You can also run these manually:

```bash
cd tools
python validate_json_schema.py
python generate_csv_from_json.py
```

---

## ⚠️ Guidelines

* **Use lowercase and underscores** for keys
* All filenames should follow the pattern: `manufacturer.enginecode.json` (e.g., `honda.k20a.json`)
* `NaN` should be replaced with `""` (empty strings)
* Unknown or incorrect keys will be renamed automatically by the script

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgment and Review

* All user-submitted engines are marked as `usr_sub`
* Maintainers will review submissions for promotion to `verified`
* Use Pull Requests for contributions
