# ðŸ§  datakase: Engine Data Archive

`datakase` is a structured engine specification project focused on organizing detailed metadata for internal combustion enginesâ€”beginning with the Honda K-series family. It includes tools for validating, transforming, visualizing, and filtering engine data in JSON and CSV formats.

## Features

* Engine JSON database (1 file per engine code)
* Automated schema validation and migration script
* JSON Schema definitions
* GitHub Pages-powered website for interactive browsing
* CI/CD pipelines for schema enforcement and CSV generation
* CSV generation of all engine records
* Extendable for any manufacturer or engine type (LS, 4BT, etc.)

## GitHub Actions

Two automated scripts run upon every push to `main`:

### Schema Validator

* Scans all `.json` files in `data/engines/`
* Loads schema from either:

  * `/schemas/engines.schema.json` (if matching folder name)
  * or `./engines.schema.json` in local directory
* Fixes structure issues, renames invalid keys, appends log
* Respects fields like `*_old`, `*_invalid`, or missing fields

### CSV Generator

* Generates `engines.csv` from the latest JSON files
* Stored in `/data/engines.csv`
* Logged in `/tools/logs/export_to_csv.log`

## How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/datakase.git
cd datakase/tools
python validate_and_migrate.py  # Validates & patches JSONs
python export_to_csv.py         # Rebuilds engines.csv
```

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed and your working directory has access to the schema and JSON folders.

---

## GitHub Pages Website

The site lives under the `docs/` directory and is hosted at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/datakase/
```

It supports:

* Search
* Free-text filtering
* Column sorting
* (Soon) Faceted filtering by engine metadata

To preview locally:

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Contributing Engines

1. Add new JSON files to `data/engines/`, following the format of existing files.
2. Validate using `validate_and_migrate.py`
3. Submit a PR with any source citations if possible

File names should use this format:

```
<manufacturer>.<engine_code>.json  # e.g., honda.k24a.json
```
